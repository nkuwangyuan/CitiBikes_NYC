"The Utilization of 12,000 Citi Bikes in New York City"

Citi Bike is a public bicycle sharing system serving New York City, NY and Jersey City, NJ. Unlike taxis, Citi Bikes cannot pick up and drop off at any arbitrary point in the city. Instead, riders can pick up and drop off bike at finite number of stations across the city. This project uses the Citi Bike trip data of September 2017 to identify the user of Citibike, estimate the cycling time, and figure out the Citi Bike stations located pattern. The data analysis is done by R and Stata. Main works include:

• Merge and clean 50 million monthly rides history data and 250,000 annually membership data

• Explore the popularity of the bike utilization between 750 stations in 60 neighborhoods

• Visualize the bike station location by clustering analysis with k-mean algorithm

• Estimate the cycling time by fixed-effect regression and analyze the trends by user categories: age, gender, membership

• Compare the trip duration / distance during time in a day, days in a week, and months in a year
